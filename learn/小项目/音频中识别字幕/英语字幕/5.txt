 Cybercrime With advancements in internet technology, cybercrime is rising. Experts say that modern criminals can steal more with a keyboard than they can with a gun. Internet technology has not only given traditional crimes such as fraud a new form, but also brought cybercrimes like hacking. Let's look at these cybercrimes together. Fraud is a crime that tricks victims out of money or property. Internet fraud is similar. Criminals use the internet to cheat others to get money or property. Besides fraud, there's ransomware. Holding someone or something for ransom means refusing to release it until money is paid. Ransomware works in the same way. Criminals will use ransomware to threaten to publish the victim's data, or to block their access to their own data until a huge ransom is paid. But to hack means to cut or chop. In cyberworld, hacking involves illegally breaking into a computer system or network. Usually hackers do it either to make a profit, or to gather secret or important information to use or sell. Fishing comes from the analogy to fishing. Fishing is the crime of tricking people into giving sensitive information. By faking official websites or by sending emails and text messages, criminals try to get user names, passwords, and financial information. Those cybercrime has a short history. It is now a major security threat. Cybercrime prevention needs our joint effort and every internet users awareness of risks.

网络犯罪 随着互联网技术的进步，网络犯罪日益猖獗。专家称，现代罪犯用键盘窃取的东西比用枪窃取的东西还多。互联网技术不仅赋予了诈骗等传统犯罪以新的形式，也带来了黑客等网络犯罪。让我们一起来看看这些网络犯罪。诈骗是一种骗取受害人钱财的犯罪。网络欺诈与此类似。犯罪分子利用网络骗取他人钱财。除了欺诈，还有勒索软件。勒索赎金是指在支付赎金之前拒绝释放某人或某物。勒索软件也是如此。犯罪分子会利用勒索软件威胁公布受害者的数据，或阻止他们访问自己的数据，直到支付巨额赎金为止。但是，“黑客 ”的意思是 “切割 ”或 “砍断”。在网络世界中，黑客攻击是指非法侵入计算机系统或网络。黑客通常是为了牟利，或者是为了收集秘密或重要信息以供使用或出售。钓鱼（Fishing）来源于钓鱼的比喻。钓鱼是一种诱骗他人提供敏感信息的犯罪。通过伪造官方网站或发送电子邮件和短信，犯罪分子试图获取用户名、密码和财务信息。这些网络犯罪的历史并不长。现在，它已成为一个重大的安全威胁。预防网络犯罪需要我们的共同努力和每个互联网用户的风险意识。
