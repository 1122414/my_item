 Medical issues for the 21st century. Advances in modern technology have brought much convenience, yet, along with the benefits there are some health concerns. Take hearing loss for example. Some teenagers like to wear headphones for long periods of time and listen to music at a high volume. This might lead to hearing loss, a condition that commonly affects the elderly before. Obesity is another health threat. Due to the use of computers, most people sit longer than previous generations. This means they have far less opportunity for physical activities than in the past. As one study found, people who work over 40 hours a week are about 8% more likely to be obese. Of course, some health risks relate to smartphones. The smartphone has become such a necessity that many of us cannot imagine living without it. People spend an estimated 3.5 hours a day looking at their phones, something that can lead to back and neck pain. Smartphones may also cause stomach pain. A 2011 study found that 16% of smartphones are contaminated with the coli, a type of bacteria that can result in stomach pain. In addition to physical risks, psychological problems may emerge when people become overly attached to their phones. Constantly checking social media may cause stress and people may feel anxious when unable to access their mobile phones. Now that you know the health risks related to modern technology, try to use your electronic devices rationally. Don't let them take over your life and damage your physical and psychological health.

21 世纪的医疗问题。现代科技的进步带来了许多便利，但在带来好处的同时，也存在一些健康问题。以听力损失为例。一些青少年喜欢长时间戴耳机，用高音量听音乐。这可能会导致听力损失，而听力损失是老年人常患的疾病。肥胖是另一个健康威胁。由于电脑的使用，大多数人坐的时间比上一代人更长。这意味着他们进行体育活动的机会比过去少得多。一项研究发现，每周工作时间超过 40 小时的人肥胖的可能性要高出 8%。当然，有些健康风险与智能手机有关。智能手机已成为生活必需品，以至于我们中的许多人无法想象没有它的生活。据估计，人们每天花 3.5 个小时看手机，这可能会导致背部和颈部疼痛。智能手机还可能导致胃痛。2011 年的一项研究发现，16% 的智能手机受到大肠杆菌污染，这种细菌可导致胃痛。除了身体上的风险，当人们过度依赖手机时还可能出现心理问题。不断查看社交媒体可能会造成压力，无法使用手机时人们可能会感到焦虑。既然你已经知道了现代科技对健康的危害，那就尽量合理地使用电子设备吧。不要让它们占据你的生活，损害你的身心健康。
