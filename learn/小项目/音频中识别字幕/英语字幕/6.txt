 The future of transportation. Transportation is essential to modern life. As you try to imagine what the future of transportation will be like, be sure to consider these three new ways of transportation. The first type of new transportation I would like to introduce is the drone. From filmmaking to emergency response to delivering packages, drones can be used in a wide range of fields. In the transportation alone, the commercial value of drones is estimated to reach $13 billion dollars during this decade alone. Chinese companies are leading this industry, having captured 70% of the global market. Next, I'll talk about a big change in the ways we commute. Artificial intelligence is poised to make driving a thing of the past, because major manufacturers are planning to put A on behind the wheel. In fact, driverless vehicle technology should lead to safer road conditions and enhance mobility. Soon, everyone can sleep or read as they ride. The last type is called the Hyperloop. It was first put forward by science fiction writers. A Hyperloop is a sealed capsule inside a vacuum, too, propelled by magnetic levitation. It will take you in less than two hours from Beijing to Guangzhou. This because the Hyperloop will speed at more than 1,200 kilometers an hour. What is your vision of the future transportation? Let's stay curious and brave to bring more wonderful fantasies and reality.

交通的未来。交通对现代生活至关重要。当你尝试想象未来的交通方式时，一定要考虑这三种新的交通方式。我想介绍的第一种新型交通工具是无人机。从拍摄电影、应急响应到运送包裹，无人机可以应用于广泛的领域。仅在运输领域，无人机的商业价值预计在本十年内就将达到 130 亿美元。中国公司正在引领这一行业的发展，占据了全球市场的 70%。接下来，我要谈谈我们通勤方式的一个重大变化。人工智能有望让驾驶成为过去，因为各大制造商正计划让人工智能驾驶汽车。事实上，无人驾驶汽车技术应能带来更安全的道路状况，并提高机动性。不久之后，每个人都可以边开车边睡觉或阅读。最后一种被称为 Hyperloop。它最早是由科幻小说家提出的。Hyperloop 也是一个真空密封舱，由磁悬浮推动。从北京到广州只需不到两个小时。这是因为 Hyperloop 的时速将超过 1200 公里。您对未来交通的愿景是什么？让我们保持好奇和勇气，把更多美好的幻想变为现实。
